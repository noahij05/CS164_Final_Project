# CS164_Final_Project
-------------------------------
This is my final project for CS164, Computer Networks at UCR  
This project demonstrates a simple social media platform. A server is set up and multiple clients are able to connect and intereact with each other  
So long as the server is running, clients can:  
```
Message each other, even if the recipient is offline
Join, leave, and messsage group chats
Broadcast messages
Check their inboxes
```
